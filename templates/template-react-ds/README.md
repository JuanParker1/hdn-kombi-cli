## ðŸš€ Start the project

We have some presets before installing the project, to do this we use the Make tool in order to execute a sequence of commands. In one of these commands _yarn install_ is executed too.

If you don't have Make Tools, to install it in Ubuntu, use this command.

```
sudo apt-get install make
```

And after use this command

```
make
```

It already install all packages.
